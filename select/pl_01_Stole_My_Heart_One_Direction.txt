(waiting for a girl like you)
The light shines
It's getting hot on my
shoulders
I don't mind
This time it doesn't matter
Cos your friends they look good
And you look better
Don't you know all night
I've been waiting for a
girl like you to come around
(round, round)
Under the lights tonight
You turned around and you
stole my heart
With just one look
when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl to
steal my heart tonight
With just one look girl
Been waiting for a girl like you
I'm weaker
My words fall and they
hit the ground
Oh life come on head
don't you fail me now
I start to say
I think I love you
but I make no sound
You know cos all my life
I've been waiting for a
girl like you to come around
Under the lights tonight
You turned around and you
stole my heart
With just one look
when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl to
steal my heart tonight
With just one look girl
Been waiting for a girl like you
There is no other place that
I would rather be
Than right here with you tonight
As we lay on the ground
I'll put my arms around you
And we can stay here tonight
Cos there is so much that
I wanna say, I wanna say
Under the lights tonight
You turned around and you
stole my heart
With just one look
when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl to
steal my heart
The lights tonight
You turned around and you
stole my heart
With just one look
when I saw your face
I fell in love
It took a minute girl to
steal my heart tonight
With just one look girl
Been waiting for a girl like you
Been waiting for a girl like you
